        <h2>My Biography</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Eric Rudzin. I was raised in Harrington Park, New
          Jersey, but I now live in Hoboken! I have a pretty small family: my
          mom, my dad, and my brother! I grew up surrounded by technology, given
          that my grandfather was an electrical engineer. He showed me a lot of
          cool things that definitely influenced me to become a computer science
          major!
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of school, I am always working! I have held many jobs since
          high school. I worked at a restaurant, rock climbing gym, and now I am
          a barista at a local coffee shop! This summer, I will be interning
          with a consulting company called Publicis Sapient as a software
          engineer!
